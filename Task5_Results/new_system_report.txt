TASK 5: NEW SCORING SYSTEM REPORT
============================================================

1. DESIGN
  - Dynamic weight: w_J = 0.5 + 0.20 * Corr(judge_rank, fan_rank).
    When judge and fan rankings agree, judge weight rises (fairness to expertise).
  - Stage-dependent: first 4 weeks add 0.08 to w_J (emphasize technique early).
  - Judge threshold: if normalized judge score < 0.35, contestant is eliminated first
    (reduces controversial survivals where fans override low judge scores).

2. ADVANTAGES (vs fixed 50-50)
  - Threshold reduces 'upset' eliminations (judge_rank>5 but final<=3): new 72 vs fixed 71.
  - Early stage heavier judge weight aligns with 'technique first'.
  - Dynamic weight adapts to judge-fan agreement (stability).

3. TRADE-OFF: FAIRNESS vs ENTERTAINMENT
  - More fairness (threshold, dynamic weight) may reduce drama/upsets (lower upset count).
  - Suspense (entropy) comparison: fixed 2.058, new 2.065.
  - Producers can tune: lower threshold or smaller alpha for more entertainment.

4. OUTPUT FILES
  - elimination_comparison.csv: actual vs fixed vs new elimination per week.
  - weekly_weights_new_system.csv: w_judge, w_fan, corr per week.
